Supervisor: Philip B. Jackson
VR Simulation

The Unity project files are all in this repository. Including playable executable in the "New Unity Project"->"Senior Project 2020" folder.

Testing instructions:
When in the executable, use mouse to look around. Use WASD keys to move around. To exit: I switch to a different tab using ALT-TAB, then exiting the app by closing it.

Senior Project V1.0 (7/21):
-Set up a classroom looking area to display environment, furniture, and models. They are not solid (can walk through it all).
-Setup is purely visual for looking at textures, materials, models, sizing ratios, overall looks
-No interactions or scripts
